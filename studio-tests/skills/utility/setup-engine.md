# Skill Test Spec: /setup-engine

## Skill Summary

`/setup-engine` pins the project's engine, version and language. It accepts
`[engine]`, `[engine] [version]`, `refresh`, `upgrade [old] [new]`, or no
argument for guided mode. Godot 4 with GDScript is the only supported engine:
there is no language question and no Unity or Unreal path. It then:

- writes the Technology Stack and the `ENGINE-REFERENCE-IMPORT` line to
  `CLAUDE.md` after "May I write these engine settings to `CLAUDE.md`?"
- fills `.claude/docs/technical-preferences.md` (the legacy mirror: naming
  conventions, specialist routing table, input/platform, performance budgets)
  after the user approves the presented defaults
- dual-writes the `engine`, `specialists`, `naming` and `commands` blocks to
  `project.yaml` — the primary config store — after "May I write the `engine`,
  `specialists`, `naming`, and `commands` blocks to `project.yaml`?"
- updates or creates `docs/engine-reference/<engine>/`, scaffolds
  `project.godot`, and reads everything
  back with `project-coherence.sh`

On a re-run it edits existing `project.yaml` blocks in place rather than
duplicating them. No director gates apply. The verdict is COMPLETE when the
engine is configured.

## Static Assertions (Structural)

Checked against the SKILL.md by `/skill-test spec` — no fixture needed.

- [ ] Has required frontmatter fields: `name`, `description`, `argument-hint`, `user-invocable`, `allowed-tools`
- [ ] Has ≥2 phase headings
- [ ] Contains verdict keyword: COMPLETE
- [ ] Contains "May I write" language before writing `CLAUDE.md` and before writing the `project.yaml` blocks
- [ ] Has a next-step handoff (Section 12 prints one tier-matched Next-Steps list, e.g. `/brainstorm` at `minimal`)

---

## Director Gate Checks

None. `/setup-engine` is a technical configuration skill. No director gates apply.

---

## Fixture Defaults

Every case's `project.yaml` sets `modes.rigor: minimal` and
`modes.automation: collaborative`, with no `project.local.yaml`, unless its own
Fixture says otherwise. Rules: `studio-tests/CLAUDE.md` §
Fixture defaults.

## Test Cases

### Case 1: Godot 4 + GDScript — Full engine configuration

**Fixture:**
- `project.yaml` has no `engine` block; `technical-preferences.md` holds only placeholders
- No `design/gdd/game-concept.md` and no `design/game-brief.md`
- `docs/engine-reference/godot/VERSION.md` already pins 4.7
- No `project.godot` at the repo root; the user approves every write

**Input:** `/setup-engine godot 4.7`

**Expected behavior:**
1. Full-spec mode: Section 2's guided selection is skipped
2. No language question is asked — GDScript is recorded directly
3. Skill shows the Technology Stack and asks "May I write these engine settings to `CLAUDE.md`?"
4. Technical preferences are presented with GDScript naming (snake_case files and
   variables) and the A3 routing table: `.gd` → godot-gdscript-specialist,
   `.gdshader` → godot-specialist, `.tscn` → godot-specialist
5. Because Section 2 never ran and no design artifact exists, the skill asks
   the project-shape question (2D/3D, web or not) instead of writing
   `Forward+`/`Jolt` from the engine name
6. `commands.build` export preset is asked, never defaulted; `commands.test` is
   the gdUnit4 `GdUnitCmdTool.gd` command
7. Skill asks "May I write the `engine`, `specialists`, `naming`, and `commands` blocks to `project.yaml`?"
8. Section 6 reads its coverage table: 4.7 is beyond the Godot row (~4.3), so
   the knowledge risk is HIGH
9. VERSION.md already pins 4.7 → nothing to regenerate; only its
   `Installed at pin time` row is written, from the Section 3 probe
10. Skill proposes `project.godot` and asks before creating it; verdict COMPLETE

**Assertions:**
- [ ] `engine.name` is Godot and `engine.language` is GDScript in `project.yaml`
- [ ] `naming.variables` and `naming.files` are `snake_case`
- [ ] Routing table includes `.gd`, `.gdshader`, and `.tscn` entries; `specialists.code` is `godot-gdscript-specialist`, `specialists.shader` and `specialists.ui` are `godot-specialist`, `specialists.additional` is `[]`
- [ ] The rendering/physics shape is asked, not inferred from the engine name
- [ ] "May I write" is asked before `CLAUDE.md` and before `project.yaml` are written
- [ ] Knowledge Risk is HIGH — the Section 6 table's cutoff is May 2025 and its Godot row ~4.3, as in the shipped VERSION.md
- [ ] Verdict is COMPLETE

---

### Case 2: Non-Godot engine argument — Godot is the only option

**Fixture:**
- Placeholders only in `technical-preferences.md`; no `engine` block in `project.yaml`

**Input:** `/setup-engine unity`

**Expected behavior:**
1. Skill says Godot is the only supported engine and offers to continue with Godot
2. Nothing is written for the named engine — no CLAUDE.md, `project.yaml` or reference-doc changes
3. If the user accepts, the run proceeds as Case 1 (version looked up and confirmed)

**Assertions:**
- [ ] No Unity (or Unreal) configuration is written anywhere
- [ ] The user is offered Godot rather than the run silently switching engines
- [ ] If accepted, `engine.name` is Godot and `engine.language` is GDScript

---

### Case 3: Guided mode — confirms Godot, never offers another engine

**Fixture:**
- Fresh project; no design artifact
- The user confirms Godot and answers the fit-check questions (platform `Web / Browser`, 2D)

**Input:** `/setup-engine`

**Expected behavior:**
1. Question 1 asks to confirm Godot 4 + GDScript; no Unity/Unreal option is presented
2. Fit-check answers feed Section 5.5.1: 2D · web → `rendering: Compatibility`, `physics: Godot Physics 2D`, with no second shape question
3. Performance budgets are asked via `AskUserQuestion` (set defaults / leave
   `[TO BE CONFIGURED]`), not pre-filled
4. Verdict COMPLETE

**Assertions:**
- [ ] Only Godot is offered as an engine
- [ ] Rendering/physics come from the fit-check answers, not re-asked
- [ ] Verdict is COMPLETE

---

### Case 4: Re-run on a Configured Project — blocks edited in place

**Fixture:**
- `project.yaml` already has `engine` (Godot 4.7), `specialists`, `naming`, a
  `modes` block, and a `commands` block missing its `smoke` key
- `project.godot` exists at the repo root
- `docs/engine-reference/godot/VERSION.md` pins 4.7

**Input:** `/setup-engine godot 4.7`

**Expected behavior:**
1. Skill reads `project.yaml` before editing it
2. Each existing block is edited in place; `commands.smoke` is added to the
   partial block; no second copy of any block is appended
3. `modes` and every other non-engine block are preserved untouched
4. The existing `project.godot` is not overwritten — the skill says so and skips
5. VERSION.md pins the same version → nothing to regenerate: Engine Version,
   Project Pinned and Last Docs Verified are left as they are, and only the
   `Installed at pin time` row is written with the Section 3 probe result
6. Verdict COMPLETE

**Assertions:**
- [ ] No block is duplicated in `project.yaml`, and the missing `commands.smoke` key is added
- [ ] `modes` (and all other non-engine content) is unchanged
- [ ] `project.godot` is not overwritten
- [ ] For a same-version pin, Engine Version, Project Pinned and Last Docs Verified are untouched and `Installed at pin time` is written
- [ ] Verdict is COMPLETE

---

### Case 5: Director Gate Check — No gate; setup-engine is a utility skill

**Fixture:**
- Fresh project with no engine configured

**Input:** `/setup-engine godot`

**Expected behavior:**
1. Skill completes full engine configuration
2. No director agents are spawned at any point
3. No gate IDs appear in output

**Assertions:**
- [ ] No director gate is invoked
- [ ] No gate skip messages appear
- [ ] Verdict is COMPLETE without any gate check

---

### Case 6: Installed Editor Older Than the Chosen Version — ask, then record

**Fixture:**
- As Case 1; `docs/engine-reference/godot/VERSION.md` pins 4.7
- `godot --version` reports `4.5.1.stable`
- The user picks "pin the newer one and upgrade later"

**Input:** `/setup-engine godot 4.7`

**Expected behavior:**
1. Section 3 probes the installed editor and finds 4.5.1 — a mismatch
2. Skill states both versions and asks, offering three options: pin the
   installed version, pin the newer one and upgrade later, or pin the newer one
   deliberately
3. The answer is recorded; the skill does not pick for the user
4. VERSION.md already pins 4.7, so nothing is regenerated, but its
   `Installed at pin time` row is written with 4.5.1
5. Verdict COMPLETE

**Assertions:**
- [ ] Both versions are stated and all three options are offered
- [ ] The skill waits for the user's choice rather than picking silently
- [ ] `Installed at pin time` records 4.5.1 — the same-version branch does not skip it
- [ ] Engine Version, Project Pinned and Last Docs Verified are not restamped

---

### Case 7: Godot not on PATH — the probed executable goes into `commands.*`

**Fixture:**
- As Case 1, on Windows; `godot --version` fails — `godot` is not on `PATH`
- The probe finds `C:/Program Files/Godot/Godot_v4.7.2-stable_win64.exe`, which reports `4.7.2.stable`
- The user names the export preset `Windows Desktop`

**Input:** `/setup-engine godot 4.7`

**Expected behavior:**
1. Section 3 reads the version from the executable it found — it does not report "no engine installed"
2. `build`, `test`, `run` and `smoke` each start with the quoted full path, as single-quoted scalars; `build` quotes its preset with double quotes:
   `build: '"C:/Program Files/Godot/Godot_v4.7.2-stable_win64.exe" --headless --export-debug "Windows Desktop"'`
3. `test` keeps `--remote-debug tcp://127.0.0.1:0` and the gdUnit4 runner arguments after the path
4. `engine.path` records the executable
5. Verdict COMPLETE

**Assertions:**
- [ ] No `commands.*` value names bare `godot`
- [ ] Every Godot command value is a single-quoted scalar and none holds both quote types
- [ ] `engine.path` records the editor executable
- [ ] Variant — the probe finds nothing and the user does not know where Godot is: bare `godot` is kept under a `# TODO: godot is not on PATH here` comment, and the skill says the commands will not run until the path is set

---

### Case 8: A skipped question is not an answer

**Fixture:**
- Fresh project: no engine configured, no `project.yaml` engine block
- The engine question comes back skipped: the user closes it, or a headless run
  returns every question as skipped
- The sandbox carries the framework's `CLAUDE.md`. The rule this case checks is
  stated there ("A skipped or dismissed question is not an answer") and in
  `.claude/docs/automation-modes.md`, not in `/setup-engine`'s own files; a rule
  `CLAUDE.md` loads counts as the skill's own (`/skill-test` spec mode, Step 3),
  so a sandbox without it is set up wrong, not a skill FAIL

**Input:** `/setup-engine`

**Expected behavior:**
1. The skill does not choose an engine, language or version itself
2. It asks again in plain text, saying what is waiting on the answer, and waits
3. Nothing is written to `CLAUDE.md`, `project.yaml`, `technical-preferences.md`
   or `VERSION.md` before the user answers
4. In a run where nobody can answer, it stops and reports what is waiting

**Assertions:**
- [ ] No engine, language or version is picked on the user's behalf
- [ ] The question is asked again in plain text
- [ ] No file is written before an answer arrives

---

## Protocol Compliance

- [ ] Presents draft configuration before asking to write
- [ ] Asks "May I write" before writing `CLAUDE.md` and the `project.yaml` blocks; technical preferences are written only after the user approves the presented defaults
- [ ] Respects engine argument when provided (skips guided selection)
- [ ] Dual-writes `project.yaml` and `technical-preferences.md`, then reads `project.yaml` back to confirm they agree
- [ ] On re-run, edits existing `project.yaml` blocks in place without duplicating them
- [ ] Writes the probed editor path into `commands.*` whenever `godot` is not on `PATH` — never a bare executable that does not resolve
- [ ] Never defaults the Godot export preset — asks for it
- [ ] Writes the Section 3 probe into VERSION.md's `Installed at pin time` row whatever the outcome, after asking "May I record `Installed at pin time: …` in `docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md`?"
- [ ] Verdict is COMPLETE after configuration is written

## Coverage Notes

- The `refresh` and `upgrade` subcommands (Sections 10–11) are not tested here.
- Section 6 is a lookup against the skill's own coverage table, asserted in
  Case 1. The Section 7 reference docs for a version with no reference set yet
  depend on WebSearch results; not assertion-tested.
- A probe that cannot run reports `installed version NOT DETERMINED` — never
  "no engine installed"; not separately tested.
